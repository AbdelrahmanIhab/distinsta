# Distributed Image Storage System Configuration
#
# For localhost testing, use 127.0.0.1 addresses (default)
# For distributed deployment, replace with actual IP addresses of each machine
#
# Example for distributed setup:
#   node1 = "192.168.1.10:8001"
#   node2 = "192.168.1.11:8002"
#   node3 = "192.168.1.12:8003"
